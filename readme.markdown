# FAQ

**Q - Why build Kuzando when there are a ton of alternatives out there like Evernote, RememberTheMilk and lots more?**

Kuzando was built specifically for the needs of my fiancee, Aya. We took a tour of several existing systems, and simply put, she didnt' find them fitting for her needs.
So, we decided to build something simple that would be fit for her.

**Q - Why wasn't Kuzando built with technology X?**

If you have any suggestions, you're welcome to contribute ideas or patches.

**Q - What does the name "Kuzando" stand for ?**

Nothing. We looked for something that is easy to pronounce and spell, and doesn't have lots of Google results.
